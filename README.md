# AppliedDataScienceCapstone
Repository to store all the codes related to my Applied Data Science Capstone Project, to get the IBM Data Science certificate.

In this project, I analyzed SpaceX launches using a data science approach, where I extracted information through API calls and web scraping from Wikipedia.

### Data Cleaning and Wrangling
I cleaned the obtained information to put it into tables to filter and remove insufficient or useless data.
Then, that information was modificated to eliminate null values or to sustitute them with mean values in the table.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using SQL and visualization tools, like charts libraries in Python, some features were examinated to see their correlation and characteristics prior the training section for model selection.

### Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium and Plotly Dash
Using Folium and Plotly Dash, libreries from Python to create interactive maps and dashboards; an analysis was made to visualize different relationships between features and their main characteristics.

### Predictive Analysis using classification models
Using Machine Learning models from Scikit-learn, and extremely useful Python library of Artificial Intelligence; different models were created and then evaluated to see which one was the best to implememnt in the data provided to this experiment.
